DW-NOMINATE dynamic roll call scaling in R

## Installation:

On MacOS, `dwnominate` installation requires the gfortran and Clang compilers provided by CRAN [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/).

From R, run:

```R

`dwnominate()` takes as its main argument a list of `rollcall` objects from the [`pscl`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pscl/index.html) package. The results are returned as a `dwnominate` object with estimates of legislator and roll call coordinates. Get detailed information about DW-NOMINATE options with `?dwnominate` and `help(package=dwnominate)`.
