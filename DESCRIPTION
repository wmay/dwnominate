Description: A simplified R interface to the DW-NOMINATE roll call
    scaling program. DW-NOMINATE (Dynamic Weighted NOMINAl Three-step
    Estimation) estimates dynamic models of legislator ideology using
    roll call votes, and can efficiently estimate static models
    applied to multiple legislative sessions. The results can be used
    to measure legislative ideology and polarization over time.
